# d3-randoms
Just some d3 tinkering.

To run these, download the d3.js zip from https://d3js.org/. 
Place any of the .html files into the same directory you extracted the downloaded d3.zip. 
Now open the .html file in any web browser.
Enjoy!

## Bubble Sort
Randomize picks a number n in the interval [5, 12], and it makes a random permutation of [0, n). The interval [5, 12] is declared as min/max constants in the code.

Bubble Sort performs the usual algorithm. The code includes a blocked out script for performing it on an array.
I chose one of the most simple algorithms, just to get my feet wet using d3.js.

The Circles also have an idle random 'jiggle'.
